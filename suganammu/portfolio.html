                <p>The Sparrow character is based on a combination of the Rolling Stones'
                     guitarist Keith Richards and Looney Tunes cartoons,
                      specifically the characters Bugs Bunny and Pep√© Le Pew.
                       He first appears in the 2003 film Pirates of the Caribbean: 
                       The Curse of the Black Pearl. He appears in the later sequels Dead Man's Chest (2006), At World's End (2007), On Stranger Tides (2011), and Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017).

                    In the films, Sparrow is the pirate captain of the Black Pearl, and is later revealed to be one of the nine pirate lords in the Brethren Court, serving as the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean. The character is primarily defined as a trickster who can be treacherous and survives mostly by using wit, guile, and negotiation rather than force, opting to flee most dangerous situations and fight only when necessary.
